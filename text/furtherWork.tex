For future work, we suggest to search for a cognitive approach towards a multi-pitch estimation of music, since the inference of musical attributes, such as pitch, in a polyphonic musical signal is a highly challenging problem (\cite{benetos_automatic_2019}). Further, we also propose to improve the relative estimation of note durations which is currently present in our software, for a more accurate musical transcription of musical signals. It would also be interesting to extract less mainstream musical structures, such as phrases. For instance, they can be perceived as a musician gently inhaling before playing wind instruments, the subtle shift in bow direction for string instruments, or the relative power of notes in key instruments.
