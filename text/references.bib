It is based on the information theory of Shannon, and treats the mind/brain as an information processing organ that aims to be information-efficient, in that it predicts its world, so as to use information efficiently, and regularly re-represents it, so as to store information efficiently. The theory is presented in context of a background review of various research areas that impinge upon its development. Consequences of the theory and testable hypotheses arising from it are discussed.},

	abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a family of methods widely used for information retrieval across domains including text, images, and audio. Within music processing, NMF has been used for tasks such as transcription, source separation, and structure analysis. Prior work has shown that initialization and constrained update rules can drastically improve the chances of NMF converging to a musically meaningful solution. Along these lines we present the NMF toolbox, containing MATLAB and Python implementations of conceptually distinct NMF variants—in particular, this paper gives an overview for two algorithms. The first variant, called nonnegative matrix factor deconvolution (NMFD), extends the original NMF algorithm to the convolutive case, enforcing the temporal order of spectral templates. The second variant, called diagonal NMF, supports the development of sparse diagonal structures in the activation matrix. Our toolbox contains several demo applications and code examples to illustrate its potential and functionality. By providing MATLAB and Python code on a documentation website under a GNU-GPL license, as well as including illustrative examples, our aim is to foster research and education in the field of music processing.},

	abstract = {As the call for papers suggests, there are a variety of digital and cognitive musical representations. Audio waveforms, symbolic notation, and instructions for synthesizing or manipulating sounds are examples from the digital category. They span what Wiggins et al. [3] refer to as a spectrum from “expressive completeness” (e.g., audio waveforms) to “structural generality” (e.g., sheet music), with representations such as “performed” or unquantized MIDI files somewhere in between. Recent developments in music software and underlying representations tend to be dedicated either to expressive completeness or structural generality, but not both. For example, the Web Audio API [2] supports sample-level timing accuracy, such that now it is possible to interact with and dynamically alter expressively complete audio waveforms in the browser, but symbolic representations are not within this API’s remit. In terms of structural generality, there are efforts concerned primarily with symbolic browser-based representations of music (such as the W3C Music Notation Community Group or the Music Encoding Initiative), but where the quality of audio rendered in resulting interfaces is of secondary concern. There are exceptions: Tido Music and Soundslice are two interfaces/entities we are aware of where the music representations achieve both expressive completeness and structural generality. Being commercial initiatives, however, the details of this representational feat are not publicly available. Our organization, Music Artificial Intelligence Algorithms (MAIA), Inc., has also developed a representation that achieves expressive completeness and structural generality. For instance, the following links comprise expressively complete and structurally general views, respectively, on the same underlying representation of Thomas Tallis’ “If ye love me”: • http://jam.musicintelligence.co/\#!/editor/if\_ye\_love\_me • http://crunchy.musicintelligence.co/composition As MAIA, Inc. straddles academia and industry, we decided it would be appropriate to release our specification as a public Bitbucket repository.1 The specification consists of a Composition 1https://bitbucket.org/micmaia/maia-specification/ Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Both are JSON documents, since we develop all-JavaScript systems. The Composition object is responsible primarily for when sounds will be triggered and how they will appear visually; the Instrument object is responsible primarily for what sounds will be triggered. Neither of the interfaces linked above is particularly polished, but it is timely to discuss representations that achieve both expressive completeness and structural generality, and what types of musical interactions they may support – interactions that may not be possible if the focus is exclusively on audio waveforms or symbolic notation. We are also interested in exploring the ramifications of recasting our representation in a Semantic Web mould, and what costs and benefits that would entail. Central to our current development stack is a RethinkDB database, which is useful in part because of changefeeds, enabling a client to receive change notifications from the database, and so support real-time collaboration in our applications. We are particularly interested to discuss the compatibility of RethinkDB and the Semantic Web. This design choice is based on the notion that “music is a form of living, influencing and influenced by every other form of living” [1, p. 11]. In other words, the expressively complete and structurally general representation we have developed is not a comprehensive, pristine endpoint, but a starting point or springboard for supporting established and as-yet unimagined musical activities and interactions.},

By diffusing helium in the mouth cavity or by forcing the mouth open, we then show that the resonance characteristic of the eardrum is mainly due to the middle ear cavity, composed of the Eustachian tubes and mouth cavity. Together they act as a Helmholtz resonator. Finally, we present evidence for intertympanic coupling. The vibration of one eardrum causes a concomitant motion of the other. It is postulated that this coupling forms the basis for the observed variation in vibrational amplitude of the tympanic membranes according to the direction of incident sound.},

This description is shown to improve classiﬁcation results by up to 23.3\% compared to MFCC-based models, while the compression performed by the factorization decreases training time signiﬁcantly. Using a distance-based stability measure this compression is shown to reduce the noise present in the data set resulting in more stable classiﬁcation models.

	abstract = {The wholesale efficacy of computer-based music research is contingent on the sharing and reuse of information and analysis methods amongst researchers across the constituent disciplines. However, computer systems for the analysis and manipulation of musical data are generally not interoperable. Knowledge representation has been extensively used in the domain of music to harness the benefits of formal conceptual modelling combined with logic based automated inference. However, the available knowledge representation languages lack sufficient logical expressivity to support sophisticated musicological concepts. In this thesis we present a type-based framework for abstract representation of musical knowledge. The core of the framework is a multiple-hierarchical information model called a constituent structure, which accommodates diverse kinds of musical information. The framework includes a specification logic for expressing formal descriptions of the components of the representation. We give a formal specification for the framework in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, an expressive logical language which lends itself to the abstract specification of data types and information structures. We give an implementation of our framework using Semantic Web ontologies and JavaScript. The ontologies capture the core structural aspects of the representation, while the JavaScript tools implement the functionality of the abstract specification. We describe how our framework supports three music analysis tasks: pattern search and discovery, paradigmatic analysis and hierarchical set-class analysis, detailing how constituent structures are used to represent both the input and output of these analyses including sophisticated structural annotations.

	abstract = {Outer hair cells (OHCs) in the mammalian ear exhibit electromotility, electrically driven somatic length changes that are thought to mechanically amplify sound-evoked vibrations. For this amplification to work, OHCs must respond to sounds on a cycle-by-cycle basis even at frequencies that exceed the low-pass corner frequency of their cell membranes. Using in vivo optical vibrometry we tested this theory by measuring sound-evoked motility in the 13–25 kHz region of the gerbil cochlea. OHC vibrations were strongly rectified, and motility exhibited first-order low-pass characteristics with corner frequencies around 3 kHz– more than 2.5 octaves below the frequencies the OHCs are expected to amplify. These observations lead us to suggest that the OHCs operate more like the envelope detectors in a classical gain-control scheme than like high-frequency sound amplifiers. These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the role of the OHCs in cochlear function and the causes of cochlear hearing loss.},

Like language, music is a human universal involving perceptually discrete elements organized into hierarchically structured sequences. Music and language can thus serve as foils for each other in the study of brain mechanisms underlying complex sound processing, and comparative research can provide novel insights into the functional and neural architecture of both domains. This review focuses on syntax, using recent neuroimaging data and cognitive theory to propose a specific point of convergence between syntactic processing in language and music. This leads to testable predictions, including the prediction that that syntactic comprehension problems in Broca's aphasia are not selective to language but influence music perception as well.},

In all cases, the signal frequency (fs) was higher than the masker frequency (fm), either by a certain ratio (1.44) or by a certain distance [3 equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs)]. The purpose was to evaluate the effect of overall frequency on the slope of the steep portion of the GOM function, and to evaluate the change in slope that can occur at high levels. Signal frequency ranged from 400 to 5000 Hz, and masker level ranged from 40 to 95 dB SPL. On average, the slope of the steep portion of the GOM function was about 1.4 for signal frequencies from 400 to 750 Hz, and 2.0 for signal frequencies from 1944 to 5000 Hz. This is consistent with the possibility that the cochlea may behave more linearly at the apical (low-frequency) region than at the basal (high-frequency) region. In addition, for signal frequencies at and above 750 Hz, the slope of the masking function changed from a value much greater than 1.0 to a value of 1.0 at high levels. The change in slope was better correlated with signal sensation level (i.e., amount of masking) than with either signal or masker SPL; the lack of a change at the lower signal frequencies may reflect the smaller amounts of masking there. The change to a linear growth of masking may represent a change in the response to the signal from compressive to linear at high levels.},

The magnitude of a tone is taken as the logarithm of the ratio of its pressure to the threshold value, and masking is taken as the logarithm of its threshold value with masking to that without. The curves of masking as function of magnitude are approximated straight lines as a rule except for rounded feet, of slope s intersecting the magnitude axis at minimum masking magnitude m. For a given masking frequency n the slope increases from zero through nearly 1.0 for a frequency near n, then more slowly, approaching about 3 to 4 for the highest frequencies measured. The intercept is small or zero below n, then increases rapidly, approaching the value 3 for high frequencies. Except when the frequencies are so close together as to produce beats, the masking is greatest for tones nearly alike. When the masking tone is loud it masks tones of higher frequency better than those of frequency lower than itself. When the masking tone is weak, there is little difference. If the masking tone is introduced into the opposite ear, no appreciable masking occurs until the intensity is sufficient to reach the listening ear through the bones of the head. At intensities considerably above minimum audibility, there is no longer a linear relation between the sound pressure and the response of the ear. Data are given showing combinational tones resulting from this non-linearity when two tones are simultaneously introduced in the ear. The presence also of subjective overtones in a loud tone accounts for the large amount of masking of tones higher than itself by a loud masking tone.},

Its perceptual representation has been explored as a multidimensional attribute whose different dimensions can be related to abstract spectral, temporal, and spectrotemporal properties of the audio signal, although previous knowledge of the sound source itself also plays a role. Perceptual dimensions can also be related to acoustic properties that directly carry information about the mechanical processes of a sound source, including its geometry (size, shape), its material composition, and the way it is set into vibration. Another conception of timbre is as a spectromorphology encompassing time-varying frequency and amplitude behaviors, as well as spectral and temporal modulations. In all musical sound sources, timbre covaries with fundamental frequency (pitch) and playing effort (loudness, dynamic level) and displays strong interactions with these parameters.},

The model uses Hilbert space representations of sound to model perception at the level of the Organ of Corti and then as percepts such as pitch, tonic and chord. We demonstrate that the model naturally captures both pitch and chord/key distance as empirically measured by Krumhansl and Kessler. We demonstrate that our method correctly predicts the missing fundamental phenomenon, and then, inspired by the harmonic theory of Rameau, that it is capable of predicting the perceived harmonic centre of a musical sequence. We explain how the method forms a basis for higher-level knowledge structures, both in music and elsewhere, allowing predictive coding. We suggest how abstraction of musical features may be achieved in the mathematical framework and how this allows prediction (and therefore creativity) to proceed at levels of representation which are abstracted from the audible surface of music, potentially providing an account of how a composer or improviser may imagine larger scale musical structures. We propose tentative hypotheses about how the model might map on to a neural substrate.},

In fact, the new methods have already proved their heuristic value, and can be expected to throw more light on the theory of hearing.

First, it does based on only spatial attributes, does not consider non-spatial attributes in spatial databases. Secondly, when DBSCAN does handle large-scale spatial databases, it requires large volume of memory support and the I/O cost. In this paper, a novel spatial clustering algorithm with sampling (NSCAS) based on DBSCAN is developed, which not only clusters large-scale spatial databases effectively, but also considers spatial attributes and non-spatial attributes. Experimental results of 2-D spatial datasets show thatNSCAS is feasible and efficient.},

We classified a large cohort of 420 subjects including symphony orchestra musicians to be either f0 or fSP listeners, depending on the dominant perceptual mode. In a subgroup of 87 subjects, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and magnetoencephalography studies demonstrated a strong neural basis for both types of pitch perception irrespective of musical aptitude. Compared with f0 listeners, fSP listeners possessed a pronounced rightward, rather than leftward, asymmetry of gray matter volume and P50m activity within the pitch-sensitive lateral Heschl's gyrus. Our data link relative hemispheric lateralization with perceptual stimulus properties, whereas the absolute size of the Heschl's gyrus depends on musical aptitude.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0119032},
	abstract = {We present a theory by which idealized models of auditory receptive fields can be derived in a principled axiomatic manner, from a set of structural properties to (i) enable invariance of receptive field responses under natural sound transformations and (ii) ensure internal consistency between spectro-temporal receptive fields at different temporal and spectral scales. For defining a time-frequency transformation of a purely temporal sound signal, it is shown that the framework allows for a new way of deriving the Gabor and Gammatone filters as well as a novel family of generalized Gammatone filters, with additional degrees of freedom to obtain different trade-offs between the spectral selectivity and the temporal delay of time-causal temporal window functions. When applied to the definition of a second-layer of receptive fields from a spectrogram, it is shown that the framework leads to two canonical families of spectro-temporal receptive fields, in terms of spectro-temporal derivatives of either spectro-temporal Gaussian kernels for non-causal time or a cascade of time-causal first-order integrators over the temporal domain and a Gaussian filter over the logspectral domain. For each filter family, the spectro-temporal receptive fields can be either separable over the time-frequency domain or be adapted to local glissando transformations that represent variations in logarithmic frequencies over time. Within each domain of either non-causal or time-causal time, these receptive field families are derived by uniqueness from the assumptions. It is demonstrated how the presented framework allows for computation of basic auditory features for audio processing and that it leads to predictions about auditory receptive fields with good qualitative similarity to biological receptive fields measured in the inferior colliculus (ICC) and primary auditory cortex (A1) of mammals.},

	abstract = {Mass and stiffness affect on the peculiar characteristics of transmission of the middle ear and the distinctive behavior of the cochlear mechanics. Applying the principle of the mass and stiffness, the band-pass characteristic transfer function of the middle ear has been explained. The greatest transfer function of the middle ear, approximately 24-29 dB, is observed at 1-2 kHz in both cat and human species. However, at lower frequencies, the transfer function was disturbed by the stiffness of the middle ear primarily due to middle ear cavity. At higher frequencies, the transfer function was disturbed by the stiffness of the middle ear primarily due to middle ear bones. Several examples, such as an acoustic reflex, otitis media, and otosclerosis are discussed. For understanding the traveling wave of the basilar membrane, different place tuning at certain stimulus frequencies, contrastingly shaped basilar membrane to the cochlear duct, and the structural and physical characteristics of the whole cochlear partition were reviewed in terms of changing width, mass, and stiffness from the base to apex. Being about ten times wider, more massive, and one hundredfold stiffer at the base than the apex, the nature of the cochlear partition to absorb high-frequency energy changes in fluid pressure declines toward the apex. Consequently, at the base of the cochlea, high frequencies stimuli are decoded while low frequencies stimuli are decoded at the apex of the cochlea. Due to these characteristics of the cochlear partition, the direction of the traveling wave was also proved to be in the fashion of base-to-apex always.},

Tremendous opportunities have arisen in the last decade as a result of exponential growth in available computational power coupled with progressive miniaturization of US devices. As US devices become smaller, enhanced computational capability can contribute significantly to decreasing variability through advanced image processing. In this paper, we review leading machine learning (ML) approaches and research directions in US, with an emphasis on recent ML advances.

In terms of the rich information hidden in fault vibration signals, the processing and analysis techniques of vibration signals have become a crucial research issue in the field of mechanical fault diagnosis. Based on the theory of sparse decomposition, Selesnick proposed a novel nonlinear signal processing method: resonance-based sparse signal decomposition (RSSD). Since being put forward, RSSD has become widely recognized, and many RSSD-based methods have been developed to guide mechanical fault diagnosis. This paper attempts to summarize and review the theoretical developments and application advances of RSSD in mechanical fault diagnosis, and to provide a more comprehensive reference for those interested in RSSD and mechanical fault diagnosis. Followed by a brief introduction of RSSD’s theoretical foundation, based on different optimization directions, applications of RSSD in mechanical fault diagnosis are categorized into five aspects: original RSSD, parameter optimized RSSD, subband optimized RSSD, integrated optimized RSSD, and RSSD combined with other methods. On this basis, outstanding issues in current RSSD study are also pointed out, as well as corresponding instructional solutions. We hope this review will provide an insightful reference for researchers and readers who are interested in RSSD and mechanical fault diagnosis.},

Fundamental ideas such as convergence, completeness and dense sets are first demonstrated through simple familiar examples and then formalised. Having addressed fundamental topics in Hilbert spaces, the authors then go on to cover the theory of bounded, compact and integral operators at an advanced but accessible level. Finally, the theory is put into action, considering signal processing on the unit sphere, as well as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape.

	abstract = {Data science is an umbrella term used for referring to concepts and practices of subset of the topics under artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. AI is actually a framework to define notion of intelligence in software systems or devices in terms of knowledge representation and reasoning methodologies. There are two main types of reasoning methods deductive and inductive over data. The major class of machine learning and deep learning methods come under inductive reasoning where essentially, missing pieces of information are interpolated based on existing data through numerical transformations. However, today AI is mostly identified with deduction systems while it is actually a comprehensive school of thought and formal framework. The AI framework offers rigor and robustness to the solutions developed and there is still scope for onboarding today's deep learning solutions and reap benefits of sturdiness. Data science is about end to end development of a smart solution that involves creation of pipelines for activities for data generation, business decision making and solution maintenance with humans in loop. Data generation is a cycle of activities involving collection, refinement, feature transformations, devising more insightful heuristic measures based on domain peculiarities and iterations to enhance quality of data driven decisions. Business decision making is pipeline of activities involving designing mappers from data to business decisions. The mappers are typically machine learning methods which are fine tuned to give best possible performance in a given period of study subject to business constraints. The mappers are fine tuned based on quality and magnitude of data and subdata. Solution maintenance is a critical component that involves setting up alarms to detect when a given decision maker model no longer works as desired. The maintenance work calls for repair actions such as identifying data to gather, comparative metrics of different models and monitoring the patterns and trends in the input data.},

	abstract = {A discrete uncoupling process for ﬁnite spaces is introduced, called the Markov Cluster Process or the MCL process. The process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the MCL algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inﬂation, each step deﬁning a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Expansion corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic matrix, where k ∈ N. Inﬂation corresponds with a parametrized operator Γr, r ≥ 0, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image ΓrM is obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inﬂation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. Several mathematical properties of the MCL process are established. Most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. The inﬂation operator Γr maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase diagonally positive semi-deﬁnite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix. For r ∈ N and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image ΓrM is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satisﬁed by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M , generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. The spectrum of Γ∞M is of the form \{0n−k, 1k\}, where k is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M , and n is the dimension of M . This attests to the uncoupling eﬀect of the inﬂation operator.},

We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

	abstract = {We describe a new theory explaining the perception of partly occluded objects and illusory figures, from both static and kinematic information, in a unified framework. Three ideas guide our approach. First, perception of partly occluded objects, perception of illusory figures, and some other object perception phenomena derive from a single boundary interpolation process. These phenomena differ only in respects that are not part of the unit formation process, such as the depth placement of units formed. Second, unit formation from static and kinematic information can be treated in the same general framework. Third, spatial and spatiotemporal discontinuities in the boundaries of optically projected areas are fundamental to the unit formation process. Consistent with these ideas, we develop a detailed theory of unit formation that accounts for most cases of boundary perception in the absence of local physical specification. According to this theory, discontinuities in the first derivative of projected edges are initiating conditions for unit formation. A formal notion of relatability is defined, specifying which physically given edges leading into discontinuities can be connected to others by interpolated edges. Intuitively, relatability requires that two edges be connectable by a smooth, monotonic curve. The roots of the discontinuity and relatability notions in ecological constraints on object perception are discussed. Finally, we elaborate our approach by discussing related issues, some new phenomena, connections to other approaches, and issues for future research.},

	abstract = {The fast Padé transform (FPT) is both a parametric and a nonparametric estimator that is capable of quantifying the input raw time signals without any fitting. The FPT simultaneously interpolates as well as extrapolates, and this is expected to mitigate truncation artifacts. To assess performance, it is necessary to compare the main features of the FPT with the characteristics of other parametric estimators, as well as with the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which can yield only shape spectra. The FPT can also give the shape of a spectrum, but accomplishes this in two totally different ways, with and without computing the spectral parameters (complex frequencies and amplitudes). A number of other parametric estimators used in signal processing are unable to yield shape spectra without prior extraction of the fundamental frequencies and the corresponding amplitudes. The primary goal of the present study is to assess the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of the FPT for parametric and nonparametric estimations of experimentally measured time signals from in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Robustness and steadiness of the FPT are assessed relative to the FFT by monitoring the convergence rates of these two processors through a systematic and gradual decrease of the truncation level of the full signal length. Accuracy of the FPT is verified by performing error analysis of proven validity, using a gold standard, if available. Alternatively, comparison is made between the two complementary variants of the FPT that converge inside and outside the unit circle. Efficiency of the FPT is checked with respect to the FFT for estimation of the shape of a spectrum, as well as relative to other parametric processors, in the case of quantifications. To establish the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of the FPT within the outlined multi-level strategy, we use a time signal encoded via MRS at 4T from the brain of a healthy volunteer. We also assess the overall usefulness of the FPT for signal processing of data acquired from patients, in light of the emerging appreciation that spectroscopy of the tissue metabolites offers a number of vital advantages over the corresponding anatomical imaging in diagnostics. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Background/objective: 
There are two routine pulse-sequences for single voxel spectroscopy (SVS), point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM). Although STEAM has several advantages in comparison to PRESS, signal/noise ratio (SNR) superiority of PRESS makes it the first choice for SVS. Application of fast Padé transform (FPT) instead of Fast Furrier transform (FFT) might increase the SNR of the signal produced by STEAM pulse-sequence and therefore allows the benefits of its advantages. We aimed to evaluate and compare the noise root mean square (RMS) and SNR provided by STEAM pulse-sequence using both FPT and FFT.

Materials and method:
A gelatin-based phantom was constructed in a 19-cm acrylic cylinder. The phantom had two normal/tumoral parts. The SVS was performed using a 3T MRI scanner. STEAM pulse-sequence were used with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TM = 10 ms, and three TEs of 20, 135 and 270 ms with two data-points of 1024 and 512 and voxel-size of 1 cm3. The raw data were extracted and processed using both FFT and FPT estimators to produce the spectrum. The noise RMS and SNR of Cho and Cr metabolites were assessed.

Results:
According to the results, noise RMS of spectra provided by FPT were decreased between 3619.01-14252.94\% in comparison to FFT (p{\textless} 0.00001). The SNR of Cr1 and Cho peaks of the spectra provided by FPT were increased more than 96.80 and 97.18, respectively (0.00006},

The aim of this study is to show the utility of FPT in reducing of the scan time required for hyperpolarized ¹³C chemical shift imaging (CSI) without sacrificing the ability to resolve a full spectrum. Simulations, phantom, and in vivo hyperpolarized [1-¹³C] pyruvate CSI data were processed with FPT and compared with conventional analysis methods. FPT shows improved stability and spectral resolution on truncated data compared with the fast Fourier transform and shows results that are comparable to those of the model-based fitting methods, enabling a reduction in the needed acquisition time in ¹³C CSI experiments. Using FPT can reduce the readout length in the spectral dimension by 2–6 times in ¹³C CSI compared with conventional Fourier analysis without sacrificing the spectral resolution. This increased speed is crucial for ¹³C CSI because T1 relaxation considerably limits the available scan time.

There is in all cases a major difference to frequency maps collected using low-level sounds. In contrast, the same cannot be said of his chicken data, perhaps due to the different roles played by the BM in mammals and birds. In lizards, the BM is not tuned and it is perhaps good that Békésy did not begin with those species and get discouraged in his seminal comparative work.},

	abstract = {Background
How does the cochlea analyse sound into its component frequencies? In the 1850s Helmholtz thought it occurred by resonance, whereas a century later Békésy's work indicated a travelling wave. The latter answer seemed to settle the question, but with the discovery in 1978 that the cochlea emits sound, the mechanics of the cochlea was back on the drawing board. Recent studies have raised questions about whether the travelling wave, as currently understood, is adequate to explain observations.

Approach
Applying basic resonance principles, this paper revisits the question. A graded bank of harmonic oscillators with cochlear-like frequencies and quality factors is simultaneously excited, and it is found that resonance gives rise to similar frequency responses, group delays, and travelling wave velocities as observed by experiment. The overall effect of the group delay gradient is to produce a decelerating wave of peak displacement moving from base to apex at characteristic travelling wave speeds. The extensive literature on chains of coupled oscillators is considered, and the occurrence of travelling waves, pseudowaves, phase plateaus, and forced resonance in such systems is noted.

Conclusion and significance
This alternative approach to cochlear mechanics shows that a travelling wave can simply arise as an apparently moving amplitude peak which passes along a bank of resonators without carrying energy. This highlights the possible role of the fast pressure wave and indicates how phase delays and group delays of a set of driven harmonic oscillators can generate an apparent travelling wave. It is possible to view the cochlea as a chain of globally forced coupled oscillators, and this model incorporates fundamental aspects of both the resonance and travelling wave theories.},

	abstract = {The cochlea is part of the inner ear and its mechanical response provides us with many aspects of our amazingly sensitive and selective hearing. The human cochlea is a coiled tube, with two main fluid chambers running along its length, separated by a 35 mm-long flexible partition that has its own internal dynamics. A dispersive wave can propagate along the cochlea due to the interaction between the inertia of the fluid and the dynamics of the partition. This partition includes about 12 000 outer hair cells, which have different structures, on a micrometre and a nanometre scale, and act both as motional sensors and as motional actuators. The local feedback action of all these cells amplifies the motion inside the inner ear by more than 40 dB at low sound pressure levels. The feedback loops become saturated at higher sound pressure levels, however, so that the feedback gain is reduced, leading to a compression of the dynamic range in the cochlear amplifier. This helps the sensory cells, with a dynamic range of only about 30 dB, to respond to sounds with a dynamic range of more than 120 dB. The active and nonlinear nature of the dynamics within the cochlea give rise to a number of other phenomena, such as otoacoustic emissions, which can be used as a diagnostic test for hearing problems in newborn children, for example. In this paper we view the mechanical action of the cochlea as a smart structure. In particular a simplified wave model of the cochlear dynamics is reviewed that represents its essential features. This can be used to predict the motion along the cochlea when the cochlea is passive, at high levels, and also the effect of the cochlear amplifier, at low levels.},
