## 1. Obtain spectrogram of the signal
filename = 'violin_canonD_5'
path_input = 'fpt/data/input/scores/' #scores/
path_output = 'fpt/data/output/scores/'

spectrogram, signal = get_spectrogram(path_input+filename+'.wav', N = 500, step_size = 250,

## 2. Save the spectrogram as a csv file as png
plot_spectrogram(spectrogram, max_freq = 2000, scale=100)
ser.to_csv(spectrogram, filename, path_output)



 
## 3. Fundamental frequency estimation: Obtain the fundamental frequency of a signal and plot it in the orginal resonance spectrogram.
# Todo: optimize code: now quick workaround implemented in case we need both csv files.

f0 = get_f0(spectrogram)
plot_f0(spectrogram, f0, max_freq = 2000)
