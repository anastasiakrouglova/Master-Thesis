## Music Analysis using Spectral Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
### Density-based Clustering and Representation of Perceived Structure in Audio Signals


#### Abstract
This master’s thesis focuses on modelling a multidimensional hierarchical
structure of musical objects perceived from audio signals. Our method is
inspired from cognitive processes related to sound perception and proposes an
improvement in the precision of a Short-Time Fourier Transform. Precision,
which refers to the ability to track the parameters of a single musical object,
has been improved by employing a non-orthogonal approach to spectral
analysis, called the Fast Padé Transform. This involves decomposing a signal into damped harmonic oscillators known as resonances. Resolution, on the other hand, refers to the ability to distinguish between two musical objects. The accomplished results through
a density-based clustering approach allows us to deduce structures from
musical performances, opening up possibilities for diverse applications, such
as musical score transcription.

We conceptually step off from the mainstream approach towards data analysis and machine learning. The system I'm creating is based on abstract types, which makes it more expandable and flexible for various end-user goals. 


#### Aplications
- extracting instruments from a polyphonic audio signal
- converting music recordings into sheet scores
- ...


#### Template
The template of the thesis was inspired by the work of Edward Tufte and Gilles Castel.
